# Node.js Server

This is a basic Node.js server that routes to three different pages and displays a 404 page for incorrect links.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Routes

- `/` - Home page
